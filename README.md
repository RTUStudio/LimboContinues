LimboContinues
LimboContinues is a plugin designed to keep players continuously connected to your server, helping maintain consistent concurrent player counts.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Virtual Waiting Server on Server Downtime: If your main server unexpectedly shuts down or restarts, players are automatically moved to a virtual waiting server. This prevents players from being completely disconnected and allows them to wait until the server comes back online.

Virtual Queue Server on Server Full: When your server reaches its maximum player capacity and can't accept new connections, LimboContinues redirects incoming players to a virtual queue server. Players can wait in this queue until a spot becomes available.

Priority Reconnection on Server Activation: As soon as the main server comes back online or a slot opens up, players in the virtual waiting server or queue are given the highest priority to rejoin the main server. This ensures a quick and seamless return to the game.

âœ¨ Plugin Goal
The core goal of LimboContinues is to help players stay engaged with your server without interruption. By preventing complete disconnections during server issues and smoothly transitioning players into a waiting state, it ultimately helps maintain stable concurrent player numbers on your server.
